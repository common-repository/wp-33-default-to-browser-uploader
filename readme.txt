This plugin defaults your media uploader to show the browser uploader. Useful if your users are experiencing frequent issues with the new HTML5 uploader

== Description ==

This is a very simple plugin. When this plugin is active, users will see the browser uploader by default when opening the WP Media Uploader. They can still switch
back and forth as usual, but they'll see the browser uploader first. Deactivating returns the Media Uploader to its normal behavior.
